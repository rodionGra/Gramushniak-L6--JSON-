Describe FamilyTree in JSON format.

There should be a JSON file that describes the structure with properties such as name, age, adulthood (or adulthood) of the person, number of relatives and father and mother, which in turn are also JSON objects.

Create appropriate data classes.

Serialize and deserialize them using GSON.
